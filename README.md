Building attainable applications with Flux

---

Facebook's Flux architecture is designed to make managing complex and dynamic views simple and maintainable. This talk focuses on how Flux provides a solid base for creating and scaling front-end applications, regardless of framework or size. We will build a small application and gradually scale it out, showing how Flux helps encourage sustainable decisions each step of the way.


# Getting started

The application requires a running instance of mongodb.

Copy `development.example.yaml` to `config/development.yaml` and edit the settings to match your machine.

```
npm i
npm start
```
